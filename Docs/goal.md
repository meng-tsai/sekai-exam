# Sekai Take-Home Challenge

Build a tiny squad of AI agents that learns to recommend the right stories to the right fans‚Äîexactly what you‚Äôll do with us in production!

---

## 1 / Mission

Write code that iterates on a recommendation prompt until it consistently picks 10 highly-relevant Sekai stories for a user, given:

- **5 sample Sekai stories (below).**  
  Use these as seed data‚Äîexpand to ‚âà 100 stories with an LLM of your choice.

- **5 full user profiles (below).**  
  Use them as ground truth examples and synthesize additional test users as needed.

You‚Äôre free to choose any multi-agent framework, model stack, or hosting setup.

## 2 / High-level Flow to Implement

| Agent                | Purpose                                                             | Model Guidance                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prompt-Optimizer     | Proposes prompt tweaks based on prior evaluations.                  | Any model you like.                                               |
| Recommendation Agent | Returns 10 story IDs for a simulated new user. Must be fast.        | Gemini 2.0 Flash (or an equivalently speedy ‚Äúno-thinking‚Äù model). |
| Evaluation Agent     | 1. Reads a full user profile.                                       |
|                      | 2. Simulates the tags that user would tick on Sekai‚Äôs first screen. |
|                      | 3. Feeds those simulated tags to the Recommendation Agent.          |
|                      | 4. Computes an eval score against ‚Äúground-truth‚Äù recommendations.   | Gemini 2.5 Pro or comparable SOTA reasoning-heavy model.          |

Orchestrate them in an autonomous loop:  
**optimize ‚Üí recommend ‚Üí evaluate ‚Üí feedback ‚Üí repeat**  
until you hit a self-chosen score or time budget.

## 3 / Ground Truth & Scoring

- **Ground-truth list**: Ask your Evaluation Agent to recommend directly from the full profile + full story pool.
- **Metric**: Pick something sensible (e.g., precision@10, mean-recall, semantic overlap). Tell us why.
- **Target**: Stop when your metric plateaus or time runs out.

## 5 / Minimum Deliverables

- Git repo (any language) with a one-command demo.
- README or brief doc covering:
  - architecture & agent roles
  - caching strategy (embed & prompt caches)
  - evaluation metric & stopping rule
  - how you‚Äôd scale to production volumes
- Log/table showing ‚â• 3 optimization cycles with their eval scores.
- ‚â§ 5-minute Loom/YouTube walk-through (optional but appreciated).

---

## 6 / Review Criteria

- **Architectural clarity** ‚Äì is the agent loop clean & extensible?
- **Product intuition** ‚Äì do metric and ground-truth method make sense for Sekai?
- **Code quality & docs** ‚Äì can we run it in one go?
- **Result quality** ‚Äì do the final 10 picks actually fit the user? Runtime & token cost?

Have fun, iterate boldly, and show us how you think.  
We can‚Äôt wait to see your agents in action! üéâ
