# Rule: Use Context7 for Third-Party Library Documentation

When writing or modifying code that interacts with any third-party library (e.g., `requests`, `pandas`, `langchain`, `fastapi`), you MUST use the `context7` MCP tool to retrieve the latest, most relevant documentation.

---

## Rationale

Using up-to-date documentation is critical for:
- Avoiding deprecated functions and APIs.
- Implementing features correctly according to the library's current standards.
- Ensuring reliability and preventing bugs caused by outdated examples.

---

## Required Workflow

1.  **Identify the Library**: Before writing code that uses a third-party library, state which library you are using.
2.  **Resolve Library ID**: First, you must call the `mcp_context7_resolve-library-id` tool to find the official Context7 ID for the library in question.
3.  **Fetch Documentation**: Once the ID is resolved, use the `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` tool with that ID and a specific topic to get the documentation.
4.  **Implement Based on Docs**: Use the information from the retrieved documentation to write your code. Do not rely on your own internal knowledge without first consulting the documentation via this process.

This process is mandatory to ensure all implementations are based on the latest and most accurate information available from the library authors.
