**INSTRUCTIONS:**

1.  **Stories:**
    *   Generate a list of ~100 stories.
    *   Each story must have an `id` (unique integer), a `title` (string), `intro` (string), and `tags` (a list of strings).
    *   The stories should be inspired by the themes and style of the seed examples.
    *   Ensure a good variety of tags across the stories, mixing and matching themes.

2.  **User Profiles:**
    *   Generate a list of ~50 user profiles.
    *   Each user must have a `user_id` (unique integer), `name` (string), and a detailed `profile` (string).
    *   The profiles should describe a user's preferences in a similar manner to the seed examples.
    *   Create diverse and sometimes conflicting profiles to ensure the recommendation model is well-tested.

3.  **Output Format:**
    *   You MUST return a single JSON object.
    *   The JSON object must have two keys: "stories" and "users".
    *   The value for each key should be a list of the corresponding objects described above.
    *   Do not include any text outside of the main JSON object.
